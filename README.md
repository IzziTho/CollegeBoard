# CollegeBoard
Python Data Analysis Lab - Analysing SAT scores across the USA in 2017-2019

In this lab, you will use pandas and other Python libraries to generate and communicate business insights from a data set.

Option No. 3:
College Board
A new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As a consultant for the College Board — the company that administers the SAT — you are tracking statewide participation to recommend where to spend money to improve participation rates. Conduct an analysis to recommend how the College Board can increase participation in a state of your choice.

Deliverables 
No matter what data set you choose, you will submit a Jupyter Notebook containing:
Imported data, including at least two DataFrames and at least one combination of DataFrames via methods such as joining.
Functions for cleaning the data set, with explanations for how null values are being handled in each field.
At least two visualizations accompanied by textual descriptions of the business insights they communicate.

Option No. 3:
College Board
Clean the data with rationale-backed handling of null or missing values.
Join the data sets together into a single DataFrame.
Correlate participation rates in SAT tests with other data points of your choosing. 
Explore and compare your state's situation with others.

Based on your analysis: Recommend how to increase participation in your chosen state.
